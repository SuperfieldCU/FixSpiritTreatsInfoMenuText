# Fix Spirit Treats Info Menu Text

For some reason, the PC version of Dream Drop Distance had an error on the Info menu when feeding treats to your Spirit Dream Eaters. This causes the text to overflow the box. Presumably, whoever was porting over the text code thought that the "(Limit: X)" text should go onto its own line, not realizing that the first line won't always fit. And since this is a pretty obscure menu in a mode that isn't exactly the most popular feature ever put into a Kingdom Hearts game, it seems like nobody noticed the error.

I have altered the code to space the text identically to the PS4 version.

## Installation

Mod can be installed using the OpenKH Mod Manager. Simply open the Mod Manager, click the green + button, type `SuperfieldCU/FixSpiritTreatsInfoMenuText` into the text box, then click `Install`.

## Info

The GitHub version of this mod functions identically to using the .dddpcpatch version of the mod on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomheartsdreamdropdistancehd/mods/27). Use whichever you'd like, although this version gets automatic updates and looks better within the Mod Manager interface.
